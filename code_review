The only class I could open says that it exports data from the program so I'm not sure if I'm looking at the right thing. 
I would have found it helpful to have the method in this class commented. I understand what it does in a general sense, but would have found it very helpful to understand the exact purpose of each piece.
The class looks interesting and I may try to use it to see how it works functionally.
