Using the library to call the PDF page was a good move. I struggled to figure out what to do with the library. The size of the project makes it feel pretty pointless. Putting the searches and sorts in a library might have worked well for you as well though. Then you might be able to use the same search and spect methods on multiple forms or to search/sort by different criteria. I find it annoying how easy it is to look back on these things and suddenly have 15 new ideas come to mind.
