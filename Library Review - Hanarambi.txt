Code Review for Hanarambi

I like this class it's simple and gets the job done. I hadn't really thought of 
exporting data this way and I'll definatly have to play with this on future program.
I wonder if there are other ways to manipulate the sheet that exports and you can
have multiple methods depending on how you want the sheet to print I think that 
would be pretty cool. Overall the code is simple and self explanatory!
